  io.kubewarden.policy.usage: |
    This policy works by defining several lists of capabilities. Capabilities are specified as named in `ALL_CAPS`, but without the `CAP_` prefix.

    The following setting keys are accepted for this policy:

    * `allowed_capabilities`: provides a list of capabilities that are allowed to be added to a container. The default set of capabilities are implicitly allowed. The empty set means that no additional capabilities may be added beyond the default set. `*` can be used to allow all capabilities.
    * `required_drop_capabilities`: the capabilities which must be dropped from containers. These capabilities are removed from the default set, and must not be added. Capabilities listed in `required_drop_capabilities` must not be included in `allowed_capabilities` or `default_add_capabilities`.
    * `default_add_capabilities`: the capabilities which are added to containers by default, in addition to the runtime defaults. See the documentation of your Container Runtime for the default list of capabilities.

    The policy validates Pods at creation time and can also mutate them when either the `required_drop_capabilities` or the `default_add_capabilities` values are specified.
